# inverse-modulo
Program with graphical interface to calculate the modular reverse of a number

u is an inverse of a modulo n if there exists an integer v such that
1 âˆ’ a u = n v
or again: such as
a u + n v = 1
The modular reverse is widely used in the vigenere cipher to calculate the private key d.
